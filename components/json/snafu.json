  "description": "By definition, a snafu is a mistake, a situation that has been messed up. This composition illustrates this word in a technological context. I began this process by placing the word “snafu” strategically within a photograph I had taken. Then, I opened up the binary of the image and began making changes to manipulate and damage the file. Spontaneous moments of the image failing were captured and then complied in a new composition. The use of genuine computer glitches captures the lack of control one has when a computer experiences an error.",
